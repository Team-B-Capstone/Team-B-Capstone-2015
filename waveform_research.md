##Research on Available Waveforms

From the information I have it looks like we may only need to focus on three graph which include PAP, ABP and ECG. This is because the other waveforms are all connected to the EGC and can just be values I think. Maybe having them be options to the doctor would be interesting, but just having the main three for not would be good I think. Maybe some information from a doctor would be good about that.

**PAP** : pulmonary arterial pressure, is a measure of the blood pressure found in the pulmonary artery. This is measured by inserting a catheter into the pulmonary artery.  normal values 25/10, units mm Hg (1 mm Hg= 1330 dynes/cm^2) 

**ABP** : arterial blood pressure, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels. When used without further specification, "blood pressure" usually refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation. It is usually measured at a person's upper arm. Blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic (maximum) pressure over diastolic (minimum) pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury.

###All of these have to do with the ECG:

**ECG** : electrocardiogram, is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on a patient's body. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from the heart muscle depolarizing during each heartbeat.
Heart rate derived from ECG

**AVF** : Lead augmented vector foot

**MCL** : midclavicular line - It is one of the reference lines for 
describing position on the body's surface. It is a line dropped vertically from 
the midpoint of the clavicle of an upright person.

**V** : unspecified precordial lead
